About SHIRCUIT - yapper bot

this is a project designed to make yapping easier in multiplayer piano (MPP).

--PERSONAL NOTE FROM CIRCUIT--

i made this bot because i started a habit this year (2024) about when people are arguing just say 
"let's talk about the number [insert random number] and the letter [insert random letter]"

it turned out to be useless, but i continued using it for my comedy self, am i right, or am i right?
so this bot was made because it was hard doing that ALL THE TIME, so i just made this bot. then generally i get ideas for this bot occasionally and make the idea when i can.

--END OF PERSONAL NOTE--

this bot is planned to be used for a long time, and it's planned to be like Qhy, or Somebot8448 (if you use multiplayer piano frequently you'll know what i'm talking about.)
and now stands here, in MPP territory, shircuit, the first yapper bot on MPP.

DM "circuitsremakes" and message "mod applic" for applying for developer role. it may take a while to respond because there may be other applications going on and i'm one person.
(but rarely, in the current situations) you'll be asked questions similar to "do you have experience on coding MPP bots" and others.

if you are a known user by circuit (me) and known to be a MPP bot developer, the only things optionally needed is to learn to code in console mpp form,
if you aren't familiarized with it already.
